# Calculator

Second hardest project I completed so far from The Odin Project.

- I used CSS Grid for styling
- I used if/else too much
- The entire script needs improvement but does the job so far.
- I tried adding keyboard support for the math operations but the event listeners were mixing up and causing bugs so I only added keyboard support for the rest of the keys except functions and equals.
